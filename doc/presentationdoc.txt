Documentation for the Functions to compute Coxeter Presentations

Coxeter groups are groups generated by reflections.
Formally, this means the groups are generated 
by a system of generator and relations which includes 
the relation g^2 = 1 for every generator g. 
In addition, the other relations can be expressed 
in the form 

  (s_i s_j)^m = 1 

For each distinct i and j there is a fixed m. 

For historical reasons 
this information is traditionally expressed in 
a matrix called the "coxeter matrix".
It is pretty simple -- the matrix contains the 
integer "m" in the i,jth position. Since the 
order of i and j is irrelevant, the matrix is 
symmetric. The diagonal always contains the 
integer 1  -- since (s_i * s_i)^1 always equals 1.

So an example coxeter matrix might look 
like this: 

 (matrix-by-rows (list 1 3 2)
		 (list 3 1 3)
		 (list 2 3 1)))

This would correspond to the three relations

 (s1 s2)^3 = 1
 (s1 s3)^2 = 1
 (s2 s3)^3 = 1

plus the expected relations s1^2=1, s2^2=1, etc

The coxeter groups can be classified into families.
The classification argument is famous and can be 
found in many places. For example, I think Artin 
goes over a simple version of it in his Algebra class. 
But he doesn't call it that. I just read Richard Kane's 
version, which is as good as any. In any case, the 
upshot is that the coxeter groups can be divided 
into a few main families and an assortment of special cases. 

The families are 

the A series -- the simplices (triangle, tetrahedron, etc),
which exist in as high a dimension as you please.

the B series -- the cubes (square, cube, hypercube, etc)
again, it keeps going.

the C series -- the duals to the cube (diamond, octahedron, etc)
keeps going

the D series -- ?? I'm actually not quite sure what shape 
this corresponds to. The first interesting example might 
occur in four dimensions, in which case it wouldn't be familiar. 

the E's -- there are only five of them, and the smallest 
one is six dimensional (I think). Physicists get really 
excited by these, but they are hard to visualize. I didn't 
bother generating data for the E's, because the smallest 
is too big for me.

the F's -- well, actually, there is only one, F4. 
This is interesting because it is unfamiliar yet accessible
(I wonder what F4 looks like? We could look at it.)

the G's -- the hexagon, i.e. G2. That's it for the G's. 

the H's -- the pentagon, icosahedron and 120-cell. 
 this series quits after H4. 

the I's -- these are dihedral groups in two dimensions.
