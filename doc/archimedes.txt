This file contains a discussion of how Archimedean (and Platonic)
solids arise from symmetry groups.

If one takes a point and reflects it about a symmetry group, the
resulting solid will perforce have symmetric vertices.  If that point
has two distinct nonzero distances to chamber walls, reflecting it
about those walls (all the way) will produce an irregular polygon (the
sides will alternate lengths).  If, on the other hand, the point's
distance to each wall of its chamber is zero or equal to all the other
nonzero ones, the resulting solid will have regular polygons for 2-cells.
Now, consider doing this.  Examine each of the following Coxeter graphs,
where X indicates that the point in question is on the hyperplane 
specified by that root (and 0 that it is not):

X-n-X: vertex (with n or 2n attaching cells)
X-n-0: regular n-gon (a 2-gon is just a line segment)
0-n-0: regular 2n-gon

X---X---0: vertices (3/6), triangles, and line segments --- tetrahedron
X---0---X: vertices (2/4), and triangles --- octahedron
X---0---0: triangles, hexagons, and line segments --- truncated tetrahedron
0---X---0: triangles, triangles, and squares --- cuboctahedron?
0---0---0: hexagons, hexagons, and squares --- truncated octahedron

X---X-4-0: vertices (3/6), squares, and line segments --- cube
0---X-4-X: vertices (4/8), triangles, line segments --- octahedron

X---X-4-X---0: vertices, X---X   0 (segments), X   X---0, (triangles),
	       X-4-X---0, octahedra.  Looks like it might be a regular solid.


Observe, however, that not all things made this way end up being 
Archimedean solids.  For example,

0   X-n-0: n-gons, line segments, and squares --- n-angular prism

This is not, for whatever reason, considered an Archimedean solid (for
n not 4).  An amusing consequence is that there may be more than one
way to generate a given solid.


Take
0---0---0-4-0.
It has 3-cells
0---0---0     (truncated octahedron)
0---0       0 (hexagonal prism)
0       0-4-0 (octagonal prism)
    0---0-4-0 (great rhombicuboctahedra)
The types of 3-cells correspond to subgroups of B4 generated by sets
of 3 generators.  The actual instances of them correspond to cosets
of these subgroups.  Thus each type partitions the vertices of the object.
Thus each vertex is incident on exactly one of each type of 3-cell.

Consider the octagonal prism 3-cells.
They have 2-cells
0       0     (square)
0           0 (square)
        0-4-0 (octagon)
The other side of each of these 2-cells is the (only) other type of 
3-cell that shares that diagram:
0       0     intersects squares on the truncated octahedra
0           0 intersects squares on the hexagonal prism
        0-4-0 intersects octagons on the great rhombicuboctahedra
The intersection of two 3-cells has diagram the intersection of the diagrams.


Now take 
X---X---X-4-0.
This is 0---0---0-4-0 collapsed by squashing the tetrahedra into vertices.
The 3-cells collapse to 
X---X---X     (vertex)
X---X       0 (segment)
X       X-4-0 (square)
    X---X-4-0 (cube)
The subgroup A3 of B4 (is maximal s.t.) collapses to a vertex of this object.
Thus the vertices of this object are the cosets in B4 of this A3 subgroup.
Thus the symmetries in it fix a vertex of this object, and conversely, the 
group of symmetries of this that fixes a vertex is A3. 

How many cubes are there to a vertex of this?  Well, the vertices collapsed
from truncated octahedra, and the cubes collapsed from great rhombicuboctahedra.
They used to intersect at hexagons of type 
    0---0     
of which there are 4 in each truncated octahedron (how do I know that?), so each
vertex gets 4 cubes.
